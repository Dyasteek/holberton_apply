            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Since I was little, one of my biggest hobbies has been technology, 
                a hobby that my parents do not support or understand. 
                This hobby has been repressed due to my economic position. 
                At the age of 18 I got my first job at a local store, with this money I bought my first desktop PC, 
                after that it was all home learning.

                
                Today my purpose is to improve these skills that over time I learned by myself. 
                Trying to get scholarships but these were only small discounts from big prices, 
                of course I couldn't afford them.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">In <a  style="color: brown;" href="https://holbertonschool.uy/">Holberton</a> I will...</h2>
                <p>Thanks to Holberton's proposal, I will be able to improve my skills in the main programming languages, 
                improve my chances and take another step towards my future as a programmer. 
                The school facilities are very beautiful, from a cafeteria to a games room, 
                it gives me the space free from distractions to improve my learning possibilities.

            <h2 class="post-title">This is my cat</h2>
            <p>
                His name is Mogolico, Since he was a kitten, we noticed that he behaved differently from other cats. 
                Mogolico didn't play with cat toys, nor did he chase lasers or balls. Instead, 
                Mogolico preferred to spend hours staring at a particular wall or object. 
                He also had difficulty socializing with other cats and humans, and was easily startled.
                After taking Mogolico to the vet and running some tests, we found out that he had autism.
